What is that?!
Emergency. Emergency.

The Ladder to Heaven project is proceeding well.

What are you trying to do?!
If you want to live, then don't let go!
I don't need your pity! The flame of my passion won't lose to this heat!

RIDER BEAT
How can perfect death befall me?
We still have... Yamato.
Really?
My soul is with ZECT!
You lost your last ray of hope.
I will protect ZECT!
Fine.
But I will crush ZECT!

A rose?
Are you the gold Rider?!
But I hadn't... done anything yet.
Tendou...
As long... as you're there...

I've been waiting for this.
How dare you deceive me.
You let yourself be deceived. Didn't you see that meteorite?
Shut up! Why don't you punch back?
I don't want to sadden Hiyori.
It can't be...You also have feelings for Hiyori...
She's...my little sister.
Hey! What do you mean little sister?!
Yes?
Kagami... Please hurry back. Hiyori is...!

A meteorite is currently headed towards Earth. If it hits...the Earth will be completely destroyed.

Mr. Tadokoro.

However, do not worry. The space station has antimatter missiles that we plan to fire...to destroy the meteorite.{And destroy the meteorite.}

It can't be that this was the plan from the beginning?

The organization wouldn't do that.

The plan moves into its second stage. We pretended to bring a comet. And we brought the meteorite.

Furthermore we pretend to destroy the meteorite. We hit it with missiles.
Do you believe in an afterlife?
If we're going to be destroyed either way...then humanity can only live on in the Worms.
Right? Jacob received a ladder to heaven. Perhaps that ladder, is all we have left. Seems we have a rat listening.

A present to celebrate your marriage from me.
This... is my mother's...
It's also a memento of my mother.
Then...
If I had a brother, I'd want him to try my cooking, just once.
And then... I'd want him to say it tastes good.
Then... hurry and get better.
Then make me a feast.
However... it better not taste bad.
Shall we begin?

As long as you two are together...
Through rich times. Through poor times.
You stay close. Living to help and support each other.
Do you swear to this?
I swear it.
I swear it.
I'm sorry...

We......were deceived by ZECT. ZECT... has joined with the Worms. I......can only... ...rely on you now...
You going?
You don't need to come.
Your fight......is my fight.

Gravity device? How boring.
HYPER CLOCK UP
Gravity cannot beat my Hyper Clock Up. Your goal from the beginning was this Hyper Zecter, right? To make me appear you made the Riders wipe each other out. Then you just waited for me to appear. However, it's no use. The cradle carrying the Worm eggs is already here.
Worm eggs?! The meteorite... is a cradle for carrying dormant Worms? The missile exists to awaken them?! Like the kiss from a prince?
Right. Right now, an overwhelming number of Worms are ready to destroy humanity.
And you're okay with that?! Letting the Worms take Earth?
Whether it's the Worms or the humans, it doesn't matter. The one who finds the rose is the strongest and most beautiful. I fight just for that. A rose means "love". Scatter with my love. Rider... Kick! MAXIMUM RIDER POWER
I'm glad... I was able... ...to meet you.

It's thanks to you... Hiyori... What are you doing?

Where are you going?
I walk the path of heaven, I will save my little sister.

My grandmother once said... "Turn the tea bag inside out when the food is extremely bad." I'm going back seven years to turn it around.

Kabuto... is headed for the meteorite carrying the Worms.

But what can Kabuto do now?

It's okay.

He......walks the path of heaven. He's the man who will rule over everything.

Come for a drive with me. I'll let you meet with your friends from seven years ago.
Hyper Clock Up!

Take this. It's my gift to you.{It's a present from me.}

This is...
Was our decision a mistake?

The end of the world...It's so beautiful.

Tendou... I will see Hiyori again, right?

Hiyori is here.
Save me.
Put the belt on.
Take care of Hiyori.
It's okay.
I'm by your side.

A Different 7 Years Later
It's okay. I'm by your side.
I'm by your side.
Alright.
It's okay. I'm by your side.
I am by your side.

My boots are worn from all this walking
I'm on the brink of despair
When I close my eyes, I see a faint glimmer of your smile{I close my eyes, and your face appears, so faintly}
We used to run on the beach
With our arms wrapped around each other, as we faced the setting sun{And have our arms around each other as we watch the sunset}
Such calm, ordinary days are what make me happy
Storms may come, the wind may hurl me about, and I may be hurt
Even then, I wish to keep this love of mine
It's gonna be alright, I'll always be by your side
No matter how far apart we are, we both share this One World
Even if I turn my back to destiny, over great distances, going to a distant time
There is a place I want to come home to
I'll never leave this place for anything in the entire universe
Though we may be tiny, we both reside in this One World{It may be small, but we share One World}

Hey, you...!
